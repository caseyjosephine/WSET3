# Fortified Muscats 

Made throughout the world, typically in vineyards with cooling influences to preserve acidity. Two main styles.

## Youthful, Unaged Muscats

Made to preserve varietal character (e.g., Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise in Southern Rh	Ã´ne). Typically sweet. Skin contact is often used and wine is stored in stainless prior to bottling.

## Fully Developed, Aged Muscats

Amber to brown in color, can be luscious (e.g. Rutherglen in Australia). Raisining is used for more luscious styles. Skin contact is almost universal and oxidative aging occurs in neutral barrels.
