#Sherry

- Critically, this is a wine style that is defined by maturation processes (although it is also geographically constrained to Jerez). 

**Location**: Southern Spain, surrounding Jerez de la Frontera. Wines matured in city limits and in seaside towns of Sanlucar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Maria.

## In the Vineyard

**Climate**: Hot Mediterranean, cooled by poniente wind and heated by levante wind (this can be damaging). Higher average rainfall that most of Spain. 

**Soils**: Albariza, high chalk content with good drainage and high water retention. Rectangular pits dug between vines for winter moisture retention. 

## Grape Varities

**Palomino**: largest by planting. Low acid and neutral.

**Pedro Ximenez (PX)**: Neutral; thin skin allows it to raisinate and produce sweet Sherry. Mostly from Montilla-Morilles.

**Muscat of Alexandria**: Also used to make sweet wines.

## In the Winery 

### Dry Styles

- **Grape Handling and Fermentation**: Quick transfer to press to avoid oxidation due to high temps at harvest. Stainless steel fermentation at higher temps (for a white). Goal is to produce neutral base wine ~11-12% ABV.

- **First Classification**: In fall, lighter wines are selected for biological aging and heavier wines are selected for oxidative aging. Flor begins to form at this time.

- **Fortification**: Wines for biological aging are fortified to 15%-15.5% alcohol (ideal for flor). Wines for oxidative aging are fortified to 17% (dealy for flor).

- **Sobretabla**: More important for biologically aged wines, wines set aside before being put into a solera to ensure that flor develops.

### Naturally Sweet Styles

- **Grape Handling**: Grapes are sun-dried to concentrate sugars. 

- **Fermentation and Fortification**: Fermentation struggles due to high sugar content of grapes. Must is fermented to 17%.

### Maturation in the Solera System

- **Production**: Aged in 600-liter neutral oak barrels called butts (lol). Barrels kept only 5/6ths full. Maturation environment must be kept cool, which is challenging.

- **The Solera System**: Butts are grouped into criaderas which hold wine blends of different average ages. Wine moves between criaderas over time. This allows consistency over time.

- **Flor and Biological Aging**: Flor is made up of multiple yeast strains that form a thick layer on the wine’s surface. Needs precise alcohol (below 15.5%, cool temperature and higher humidity). 
	- The purpose of a solera is the sustain a culture of flor
	- Flor prevents oxidation (but oxidative characteristics will develop as the flor dies off).

- **Oxidative Aging**: Some styles made completely oxidatively, without presence of flor. Others combine biological and oxidative aging.

### Blending and Finishing

- Solera system production creates consistency
- Most sherries are blends from several solera systems
- Fining and filtration is common, but not required

## Styles of Sherry

### Dry Styles

- **Fino and Manzanilla**: only undergo biological aging, should be consumed fresh
- **Oloroso**: only undergo oxidative aging
- **Amontillado**: undergo biological aging, refortified to 17% to kill flor, then undergo oxidative aging.
- **Palo Cortado**: rare style with aromas of amontillado and richness of oloroso

### Naturally Sweet Styles

Rarer, and undergo oxidative aging

- **Pedro Ximénez (PX)** deep brown and lusciously sweet
- **Muscat** similar, with varietal dried citrus peel

### Sweetened Styles

- **Pale Cream**: short period of biological aging prior to sweetening
- **Medium/Cream**: only has oxidative characteristics
- **Age Indication**: this is an average age; top are VORS (30 years) and VOS (20 years). 12 and 15 year labels apply to solera system as a whole, not average age.
