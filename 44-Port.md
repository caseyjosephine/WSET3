# Port

Fortified with grape spirit during fermentation to stop fermentation and create a sweet wine. WSET 3 focuses on Red Port.

**Location:** Portugal’s River Douro; industry activities divided between twin coastal cities of Porto and Villa Nova and vineyards 70km upstream.

## In the Vineyard

Three subregions:
	- Baixo Corgo - lightest wines
	- Cima Corgo - greatest number of top vineyards
	- Douro Superior - renowned but sparsely planted

**Climate**: Warm continental, but not uniform (cooler and wetter in west, hotter and drier in east). Hazards include frosts and downpours in spring (impacting flowering/fruit set).

**Soils**: Schist bedrock, allows access to deep water reserves

**Topography**: Steep slopes of the Douro. Traditionally planted on narrow, stone wall terraces called socalcos. Patamares allow tractor access, and interfaced vinha ao alto is used on low-angle slopes.

**Grape Varieties**: many, mostly thick-skinned and high in tannin. Five major varieties:
	
	- Touriga Franca
	- Tinta Roriz
	- Tinta Barroca
	- Touriga Nacional
	- Tinto Cão

## In the Winery

**Fermentation**: stopped by addition of grape spirit when wine reaches 5-9% ABV. This does not allow for much tannin or color extraction, so techniques are used to increase extraction.
	
	- Foot treading. Yes, really. Traditionally done with teams over three to four hours in shallow granite troughs called lagares. Most common for premium wines.
	
	- Autovinifiers. Method of automation in which sealed tanks allow rising CO2 pressure to eventually release valve that circulates mixture. Like a super aggressive automatic pump over.
	
	- Piston plungers and robotic lagares. Automation that seeks to emulate foot treading. Used for premium wine.

**Fortification**: Done to between 19-22% ABV. The grape spirit used is called aguardente ( max 77% ABV). Due to low alcohol at fortification, the amount of spirit by volume is higher for Port than for Sherry.

**Maturation**: Ports are traditionally transported downstream to age where the climate is cooler, but air-conditioning has attenuated the need for transport. Neutral oak and stainless steel are used for maturation. 

Ruby and Reserve Ruby Ports are fined and filtered, while Vintage Ports are unfiltered. LBVs can go either way. Vintage Ports and LBVs benefit from bottle aging. 

Tawny Ports hit the pipe, which is the name of the barrels used for long, oxidative maturation. 

Blending is typical across all styles.

## Types of Port

Most Ports are red, but rosé styles exist and white Port and tonics are popular in the UK. Most are nonvintage.

### Inexpensive Ports

- Ruby: typically between one to three years and lacking in concentration, tannins, and complexity.
- Tawny: too young, with brown color occurring due to winemakerly adulteration.

### Special Categories of Port

- Reserve/Reserva: wines an official tasting panel determines are not undelicious. Must be aged in barrel for six or more years.
- Late Bottled Vintage: vintage wines that have been aged for four to six years prior to bottling. Generally fined and filtered; ready to drink upon release without further aging. Some are more like Vintage Port (unfiltered and suitable for aging).
- Tawny with an Indication of Age: undergo oxidative maturation in pipes.
	- Average age of 10, 20, 30, or 40 years.
	- Year of bottling included on label.
- Vintage: Flagship wine, which must be declared in the second year after harvest and bottled the next year. Some vintages are consensus, some not.
	- Single Quinta = single estate.
		- Some producers own multiple quintas.
