# Sparkling Wine Production

This is a diverse category of wine (white, red, rosé, dry, sweet, fresh, toasty, etc.).

## In the Vineyard

Some differences from still wine production:
	- low alcohol (second fermentation increases this)
	- High acid
	- *Critically* there are only a few regions that produce grapes with these characteristics and phenolic ripeness.

## Handling the Grapes and Juice

- Grapes are mostly hand-harvested
- Gentle, whole-bunch pressing to minimize color extraction

## Methods of Making Sparkling Wine

- **Traditional Method**
	- Fermentation of base wine, usually in stainless. 
	- Blending for house style, balance, and complexity.
	- Second alcoholic fermentation after addition of liquor de tirage.
		- Raises ABV by 1.2-1.3%
		- Generates CO2
		- Creates five to six atmospheres of pressure
	- Yeast autolysis and lees contact
	- Riddling is the first step of lees removal, which can be done manually in a pupitre or mechanically in a gyropalette.
	- Disgorgement and corking. Because some wine is lost during disgorgement, wines are topped with liqueur d’expédition (dosage). 
	- Bottle aging for a short period of time (a few months); meant to be consumed close to bottling
	- Mostly produced as nonvintage.
- **Transfer Method**
	- Identical to traditional method up to riddling, but wine is disgorged into tank, lees are filtered out, and liqueur d’expédition is added to the tank prior to bottling.
- **Tank Method**
	- Cheaper method that maintains character of base wine. Second fermentation takes place in sealed tank; generally no autolytic character.
- **Asti Method**
	- Juice is chilled, stored, and fermented to order. Single fermentation, initially in an unpressurized environment. The tank is sealed partway through fermentation to capture CO2. Wine is fermented to ~7% ABV, then fermentation is stopped and wine is bottled and sold.
- **Carbonation**
	- CO2 is injected into still wine.

## Styles of Sparkling Wine
