# Sparkling Wines of the World

## Champagne

One AC subdivided into villages with premier cru and grand cru designations. Five major subregions:
	- Montagne de Reims
	- Vallé de la Marne
	- Côte des Blancs
	- Côte de Sézanne
	- Côte de Bar

**Climate**: Cool continental; the marginal climate can make growing difficult. Frost is a major hazard (hillside plantings attenuate this). 

**Soils**: mostly chalk

**Grapes**
	- Chardonnay: acid/floral/citrus
	- Pinot Noir: body/structure
	- Pinot Meunier: a late-budding, “hedge your bets” kind of grape.

**Winemaking**: traditional method. Winemaking aspects of note:
	- Free run juice is cuvée; press juice is taille
	- Blending is incredibly important, primarily due to Champagne’s marginal climate.
	- There are aging requirements
		- NV - 15 months (12 on lees)
		- Vintage - 36 months (no lees requirements)

## Crémant

Produced *like* Champagne, but not *in* Champagne.
	- 9 month lees aging requirement
	- generally produced with key regional grapes

**Saumur**: local varieties, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Franc.

**Vouvray**: mostly Chenin Blanc

## Cava

- Not geographically constrained in Spain; critical factor is use of the traditional method.
- Made from Macabeo (Viura), Xarel-lo, Parellada, Garnacha, Monastrell. Sometimes Chardonnay and Pinot Noir (controversial).
- Mostly nonvintage

## Asti

- Located in Piemonte and made using the Asti method. Your mom probably likes it.

## Prosecco 

- Made in Prosecco DOC (Veneto and Friuli); higher quality examples in Conegliano-Valdobbiadene DOCG. 
- The grape name has been changed to Glera (because Italy).
- Produced using tank method.
- Typically consumed by middle-aged rich white ladies during book club to celebrate not having finished the book.

## Sekt

German sparkling style, typically produced using base wines imported from France/Italy using the tank method.  
	- **Deutscher Sekt** is the good stuff, made from German-grown grapes (usually Riesling).

## Australia

Best sparkling is from cool/moderate regions:
	- Yarra Valley
	- Adelaide Hills
	- Tasmania

## New Zealand

Since the country is located far south with the cooling influences of ocean breezes, sparkling is high-quality here. The largest region for sparkling production is Marlborough. 

## South Africa

Traditional method sparkling is called Méthode Cap Classique and sourced from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grown in the Western Cape.

## USA

Mostly produced in California in cooler climates (e.g., Los Carneros, Anderson Valley), often with extended lees contact.
